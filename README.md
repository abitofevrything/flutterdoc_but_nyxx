# FlutterDoc but nyxx

A clone of https://github.com/miyoyo/FlutterDoc, but in Dart using https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx.

Yes this uses a local development version of nyxx that isn't published yet. No I probably won't update this repo when it is published.

Oh, we do support package search though - try `![riverpod/Provider]` for example :)

A lot of the documentation fetch/search code is ripped out from https://github.com/nyxx-discord/running_on_dart.
